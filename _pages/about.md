Hello there! I am Felipe Berrutti, a fourth year PhD candidate in Economics at [Northwestern University](https://economics.northwestern.edu). I hold a BA in Economics from [Universidad de la Rep√∫blica](https://fcea.udelar.edu.uy/ensenanza-dpto-economia/licenciatura-en-economia.html) and an MA in Economics and Finance from [LUISS Guido Carli and the Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance](https://www.romemaster.it).

I am interested in empirical industrial organization and applied microeconomics. [My work](https://jfberrutti.github.io/projects/) focuses on how market structure and regulation affect firm behavior and consumer welfare in markets for technological products. 

You can contact me via <a href="mailto:jfberrutti@u.northwestern.edu">email</a>, or reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-berrutti-0bb54832).
