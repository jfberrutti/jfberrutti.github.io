Hello there! I am Felipe Berrutti, a fourth year PhD candidate in Economics at [Northwestern University](https://economics.northwestern.edu). 

I am interested in empirical industrial organization and applied microeconomics. My work focuses on how market structure and regulation affect firm behavior and consumer welfare in markets for technological products. 

You can contact me via [email](jfberrutti@u.northwestern.edu), or reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-berrutti-0bb54832).
