  <strong>Market Structure, Innovation and Prices: The Case of Agricultural Biotechnology in US Cotton</strong>  <br> 

    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    I study the impact of vertical integration in the market for genetically engineered (GE) cotton seeds in the United States. Exploiting Monsanto's acquisition of the leading cotton seed producing firm (Delta and Pine Land) in 2006, I show that (i) the vertical merger raised the prices that Monsanto charged its rival cotton seed breeders to license its GE technology and (ii) yields increased for products sold by the vertically integrated company relative to those sold by non-integrated firms. To quantify the welfare impacts of these two opposing forces, I develop a structural model of demand and supply for cotton seeds. My model accounts for bargaining between an upstream technology provider and downstream cotton breeders as well as quality improvements. I use this model to study the welfare impact of vertical integration and to estimate counterfactual outcomes without integration and without DOJ mandated divestitures.

  <strong>Price Regulation of Agricultural Technology</strong> (joint with Matteo Ruzzante)  <br> 

    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    Regulating the price of productivity-enhancing inputs can allow governments to facilitate the diffusion of existing technologies but deter private firms from innovating and introducing superior technologies. This project studies the demand and supply-side consequences of price controls on genetically engineered (GE) cotton seeds in India. Leveraging the differential timing of this policy across states, we show that the government-mandated price reduction increased farmersâ€™ adoption of GE seeds by 20pp and decreased the costs of cultivating cotton by 20%. Although cotton seed firms did not incur significant losses in the short term, the number of new hybrid varieties introduced by these firms fell abruptly in the aftermath of the policy, leading farmers to use older seeds. Using newly assembled data from experimental field trials across India, we show that: (i) cotton varieties lose 6% of their yield yearly; (ii) agronomic yields of new varieties worsen by 30% in price-controlled states. To quantify the overall welfare impact of the policy, we develop a structural model of demand and supply for seeds that allows for endogenous quality.
